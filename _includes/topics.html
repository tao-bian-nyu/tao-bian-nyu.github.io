  <h3> Value iteration in continuous-time</h3> 
  <p> Starting from an initial value function \(V_0\), the \(V_t\) converges to the optimal value function \(V^*\). </p> 
</div>
<div class="two">
<p> Originated by Bellman in 1959 as a fundamental tool to solve DP problems, VI has been widely adopted to find optimal policies for different types of systems. </p> 
<p> However, despite its popularity in the science community, VI is flawed as it is only applicable for discrete-time models. </p>
<!--   For the past few decades, researchers have been puzzled by how to extend traditional VI to the continuous-time setting. </p>  -->
  
<p> In this research work, we have made a breakthrough on this long-standing issue, by developing a complete framework of continuous-time VI with rigorous convergence analysis.</p>
