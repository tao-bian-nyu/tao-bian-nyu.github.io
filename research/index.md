My research focus is in developing artificial intelligent learning and control systems, with special emphasis on applications in energy systems (smart grids), biomedical engineering, and quantitative finance. 

In spite of their differences in many ways, artificial intelligence (AI) and control theory have been tight to each other since they were first invented. In fact, the earlist concept of artificial intelligent control system can be traced back to Wiener's Cybernetics in 1940s. It is also interesting to know that Bellman proposed his famous dynamic programming theory, which coined the mathematical fundation beind reinforcement learning, even four years before the Dartmouth workshop, also known as the founding event of AI. More recently, AI has also inspired tons of intelligent control techniques, such as neural network control and adaptive dynamic programming (ADP). My ultimate research goal is to build a unified theoretical framework to bridge the gap between AI and control theory. This interdisciplinary study will enhance our understanding of the relationship between AI and control theory, and eventually inspire numerous future works in these fields. 

<!--- My research interest is in dynamic programming theory with special focus on its applications in reinforcenemnt learning, adaptive optimal control, and stochastic optimization, to name a few. -->

<!--- its My research topic is called adaptive dynamic programming (ADP). This is a new research direction that involves different disciplines such as data science, reinforcement learning, optimization and stochastic control. Roughly speaking, we aim at developing a new artificial intelligence method for more general systems that can be used in applications including trading models, robotics, and power systems. 	-->

<!--- Our method is fundamentally based on RL theory. However, different from traditional RL methods, we take into account both stability and robustness in our algorithm. -->
