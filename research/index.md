<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

My research interest is in dynamic programming theory with special focus on its applications in reinforcenemnt learning, adaptive optimal control, and stochastic optimization, to name a few.

<!--- its My research topic is called adaptive dynamic programming (ADP). This is a new research direction that involves different disciplines such as data science, reinforcement learning, optimization and stochastic control. Roughly speaking, we aim at developing a new artificial intelligence method for more general systems that can be used in applications including trading models, robotics, and power systems. 	-->

<!--- Our method is fundamentally based on RL theory. However, different from traditional RL methods, we take into account both stability and robustness in our algorithm. -->
