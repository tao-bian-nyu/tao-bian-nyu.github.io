My research topic is called adaptive dynamic programming (ADP). This is a new research direction that involves different disciplines such as data science, reinforcement learning, optimization and stochastic control. Roughly speaking, we aim at developing a new artificial intelligence method for more general systems that can be used in applications including trading models, robotics, and power systems. 	

Our method is fundamentally based on RL theory. However, different from traditional RL methods, we take into account both stability and robustness in our algorithm.
